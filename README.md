    _ ANIMADVERSION.

    _ EXCEPTION I.

      * D. E.[A] FIrst, That he supposeth there is so strict an Union, and so inseparable a Dependence between Kings and Bishops, that they must stand and fall together, and all who are enemies to the one, must needs be enemies to the other. I know very well this Axiom is much talked of, and some advantage may be taken to confirm it, from the event of our Late Wars.]

      * D. E.[B] You know likewise, Sir, how much my Judgment is for the Order of Bishops; and how Passionate a Lover I am both of the Kings Person and Government; but yet, being thus called by You to decla•ePresbyterianissimè.the Truth, though co•trary to my own Humour and Interest, I must needs say, &c.]

      * D. E.[C] It is clear from Story, that Kings were in all parts of the world, in their most flourishing Estate, before ever Bishops were heard of; and no reason can be given, why what hath once been, may not with the same terms of convenience be again.]

      * D. E.[D] Bishops, as they are by Law established in England, are purely the Kings subordinate Ministers, in the Management of Ecclesiastical Affairs; which his Majesty may conferr upon what Order of men he pleases, though they be as much Lay Persons as You and I are. It is therefore very injurious to the Kings Authority, to averr that He could not otherwise uphold and maintain it, than by preserving the Undue, and, as some think, Antichristian Dignity and Prelation of his in•iour Officers.]

      * D. E.[E.] Bishops are so little usesul to support the Regal Dignity (which is founded upon a distinct Basis of its own) that upon enquiry it will be found, how none have been greater enemies to the True and Undoubted Soveraingty of Princes, than some Bishops themselves: for by their Officious, and fcarce warrantable intermedling in Civil Affairs; by their Absurd and Insignificant distinguishing between Civil and Ecclesiastical Causes (of which last



they have alwayes made themselves sole Judges) they mangle the Kings Authority, and as to Church-matters (which may be extended as far as they please) they leave the King nothing of Supremacy but the Name. The Pope of Rome therefore (who is the great Father of all such Bishops) hath improved this Notion and Distinction so far, that in ordine ad spiritualia, he hath laboured to subject all Civil Empires unto his sole Jurisdiction.

      * D. E.[F] [So that if the Bishop of Worcester's R•le bold good, of Crimine ab uno—Disce omnes, i. e. That all men who are of a party may be judged of by the miscarriages of one, then I must leave it to You to judge, what all those Bishops, •at are of the Bishop of Worcester's complexion, do rea•y drive at, by the fatal example of that one Bishops Usurpation: For,]

    _ EXC•PTION II.

      * D. E.[A] THat Assertion, that the Bishop of Worcester (and consequently every other Bishop) is the sole Pastor of all the Congregations in his Diocess, if it be at all defensible, I am sure can be defended only by those Arguments, which are commonly alledged to maintain the Popes Supremacy over all Churches whatever. For since a Bishop can no otherwise discharge his duty berein, than by providing Substitutes, what hinders but the Bishop of Rome may as well oversee a million of Churches, as the Bishop of Worcester five hundred? Since if Deputation be lawfull, more or lesse compasse and circuit of ground doth not at all alter the case.]

      * D. E.[B]. I forbear to •rge how contrary this Practice is to the Doctrine of the Apostl•s, both Paul and Peter (I hope the Bishop will not take it ill that I do not call them Saints, for these Holy men do not need any stile of Honour out of the Popes Kalender.]

      * D. E.[C] When Paul had sent for the Elders of the Church at Ephesus, he bids them to feed the Church of God, over which (not be himself, by his



sole Authority, a• Bishop of the Diocess, but) the Spirit of God hadAct. 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 2.made them,〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, i. e. Overseers, or to use the proper stile, Bi•hops. And Peter commands his Fellow Elders, (for so doth that Apostle 〈◊〉 to call himself) to feed the Flock which was among them,〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, Overseeing, or Acting the Bishops, not (like the Bishop of Worcester) as Lording it over Gods Heritage, but as Patte•ns of the Flock. From which places we learn, not only that those two so much controverted Names of Bishop and Pres•yter, are without distinction ascribed to the same Persons, but likewise, that whoever f•d the Flock, are under Christ (whom the Apostle there stil•s the Chief Shepheard) the next and immediate Pastors of the Flock; and to extend the Pastoral Power beyond the actual care of Feeding, is a notion altogether u•scriptural, and likewise leaves us no bounds where to fix, till we come to ce•re upon some one Universal Pastor, who may claim this Power over the whole world, by the same parity of reason, that a Bishop doth over one D•ocesse.]

    _ EXCEPTION III.

      * D. E.[A] IT seems to be a Light, and (to say no more) unseemly trifling with  sacred Scripture, to affirm that those words of our Saviour concerning such as come not in by the door, and therefore are Thieves and Robbers, ought to be understood of such Ministers, as preach to Congregations without the Bishops License. Which thing, the Bishop (in great heat and Earnestnesse, as if he had done very well in it) tels us more then once, that it was the Principal reason why he silenced Mr. Baxter.

      * D. E.[B] Truly if this practise be justificable, and those who design themselves to preach the Gospel, must, besides their Ordination, procure a License from a Bishop, to do that, which a Woe is de•ced against, if the• offer to o•t, then 1. I see not what Ordination signifies, •ce the power that 〈◊〉 is given, •o Authority from Ma•〈◊〉 away, any more then dissolve the contract of a Mariage, much lesse empeach and hinder the free use of it, except for Moral and? notoriously vicious Misdemeanours. 2. For one Minister of the Gospel (for certainly a Bishop is no more) to Silence another, and that for no better Reason, than because his Fellow-Minister is desirous to preach the Gospel without a new License, this is an abuse of Dominion, which as our Saviour doth no where countenance, so the first Ages of the Church were altogether 〈◊〉 with.]

      * D. E.[C] For the Bishop's Inst• of our Saviour's putting to silence the Scrib•s and Pharisees, is both Imperti•t and False, because our Saviour did only silence them by Argument, which the Bishop may do when ever he is a•le, but what is that to an Authoritative and im•erious commanding men to be Silent. Besides, even then when our Saviour was most strict in pronouncing Woes against the Pharisees in that very Chapter▪ he is so far f•om forbidding the Pharisees to preach, that he commands his Disciples both to hear and to obey their Doctrine. So that since the Bishop wi• needs have the Presbyterians to be Pharisees, let him but allow them the same Liberty of Teaching the People, as our Saviour did the other, and I believe they will not (at least were I a Presbyterian I should not) envy his Lordship either his Title or M•, how 〈◊〉〈◊〉〈◊〉 soever they both be. And though the Bishop is pleased to say, That the Presbyterians preach nothing but Sedition and Treason (which is most •alse, as being directly 〈◊〉 to their declared Principles) yet the Pharise•s taught something worse, and that was 〈◊〉: Yet our Saviour (who sure had more power, and withal more care of his▪ Church •hen the Bish•p of Worcester) did not go about by force to prohibit them]

      * D. E.[D] I wish therefore, that this Bishop and the rest of his Brethren (if any are Ch•lerick and Testy enough to be of his mind) would consider, that as by silencing their Fellow Ministers for such frivolous and slight pretences, they usurp a Power, which Christ never gave, so a• the l•st day he will not thank them for the Exercise of it.

    _ EXCEPTION IV,

      * D. E.[A] HOw consistent with the Civil Peace (for as to Christian Charity, the whole thing is but a Letter of d•fiance against it) the Bishops Distinction is about the Act of I•dempnity, and (•he so much fo•gotten) Act of 〈◊〉, I hope His Majesty and the Parliament will in due •i ne consider. For he is so hardy as to tell us, That the King by it only pardoned the corporal punishment; but the Church had not, nor ought not to forgive the scandal, till honourable amends were made her by confession and Recantation. Where by speaking of the Church, as distinct from the State (I mean in point of Co•rcive Jurisdiction) the Bishop would make us believe, that after His Majesty and the Parliament have forgiven men their Civil Crimes, there is still another Power, which he calls the Church, unto which they are still accountable, eve• so far as to make a Pu•lick 〈◊〉. Here I w•sh the Bishop would have s•oken out of the Clouds, and plainly told us what he meant by the Church: For if it be a Congrega•ion of the Faithful met together for the worship of God, as the D•finition of Scripture, and of the Church of England in the 39 Articles; this will not at all advantage him, since such a Chu•ch hath 〈◊〉 Co•cive or Imposing Power: But if he means the Hierarchy or Ecclesiastical State,•y Arch-Bishops, Bishops. &c. there can be nothing mor• false, or more dishonourabl• unto o• Civil Government, than to affirm that it lies in their power, not only •o pu•sh, but lik•wise to exact a Recantation, f•r those faults which the King and Parliament have not only pardo•ed, but und• sever• penalties command• sh•uld never more be remembred: And therefore I doubt not, but that they will resent this Malicious and •ll-grounded Phancy.]

      * D. E.[B] And since the Bishop is so over-zealous for the very Letter of the  Law, when it imposes Ceremonies, give me leave a little to wonder, that one of his Profession and Place in the Church should so 〈◊〉 go against it, when it enjoyns Moderation and Forgiveness as to Civil Injuries. Such as he, who make the Law, instead of being a Buckler to protect. Converts, a Sword only to cut off all such as were once Offenders, •abour what they can, to make men desperate, and thereby render the peace of the Nation and in that the prosperity and welfare of His Majesty very insecure and hazardous. For what can mo• inrage Men to take wild and forbidden courses, than to see even Preachers of the Gospel strive to widen their wounds, and contrary to their own former Professions, to pull off that Plaister, which the wisdom of our St•-Physitians had provided to •eal our distempers.]

    _ EXCEPTION V.

      * D. E.[A] IT is bold and impious (I know not how to express it more mild'y)  what he affirms, That I• to command an Act, which by accident may prove an occasion of sin, be sinful, then God himself cannot command any thing. For, though, as I said before, I will by no means own that Assertion, yet, a thing which by accident may become sinful, may be unlawful in another to command, for want of sufficient Authori•y; whereas God's Sovereign Power doth without dispute or controversie make all his Commands to be just; and therefore his Name ought not to be mentioned in our trivial Disputes, because every such vain use of it, is nothing but a diminution and lessening of his Greatness.

    _ EXCEPTION VI.

      * D. E.[A] THat an offence, to which a disproportionable penalty is annexed, is not to be measured by the quality of the Act considered in it self, but by the mischievous consequences it may produce; whether this ought to hold good in Civill Lawes, becomes neither the Bishop nor me to dispute: but in Divinity nothing can be more false and dangerous. For to impose in the •orship of God as necessary circumstances of it, things confessedly trivial and needless; and upon the forbearance of them, to debar any from the benefits first of Christian, and then of Civil Communion; is a thing which hath not the least, pretence of Scripture or Primitive practice to justifie it. For, our Saviour te•s us. That


whosoever were not against him were for him; and the Apostle bids us to receive our weak Brother, and not to judge, much less to burden his Conscience.]

      * D. E.[B] Unto which sacred Canon nothing can be more directly contrary,  than what the Bishop most incompassionately tels us, That the Lawes do well to punish, even with non-admission to the Sacramen•, such as will not, or perhaps dare not, kneel. And the Reason he gives is equally Apocrypha, Because, saith he, it becomes not the Law-givers to endanger the Churches peace for their sake: As if first, It did not much more become all Law-givers in the things of God, to observe the Law of Christ, which is a Law of Love and Liberty. Secondly, As if the Churches peace would not be much more endangered, by the pressing of things doubtful, than by the forbearance of them. For since by the enforcing of such things, as God hath no where commanded, our Christian liberty is in•inged; from hence it follows, that, if we ought not, yet we lawfully may


refuse, to sub•t unto such Impositions; as our Saviour did, in not washing his hands before meat; and the Apostle Paul, in the case of Circumcision.]

    _ EXCEPTION VII.

      * D. E.[A] AS for the Chain of Consequences, which the Bishop li•ks and  ti•s together: As that from Diversity in external •ites, ariseth Dislike; from Dislike, Enmity; from Enmity, Opposition; thence, Sehism in the Church, and Sedition in the State: For 〈◊〉 of which he doth very virulently instance in our unhappy times. To prevent which he tels us, That the State cannot be safe without the Church, nor the Church without Unity, nor Unity without Uniformity, nor uniformity without a strict and rigorous Imposition. To all this I answer, that it is a 〈◊〉 Rope of sand, and the parts of his Chain do 〈◊〉 little hang together; as Sampsons Foxes did before they were tied by the Tails, which course the Bishop hath imitated, not forgetting to put in even the Firebrand it self to make up the Comparison.]

      * D. E.[B] Nothing is more clear than that there hath been, nay, ought to be, Diversity in external Forms, without any Dislike at all as to the Person of another: For, the Apostles that preached to the circumcision gave the right hand of Fellowship unto the Apostles of the Gentiles; although their Outward Rites in publick Worship, were far more different than those, which, by any of the most distant perswasions, are now practised i•England. 2. The State may be prefer•ed, without the least reference to the Church, unlesse it turns Pe•secuter of it; as is evident i• those 300 years before Constantine's time, in which there was no Church at all legally countenanced; and for some scores of years after, both the Christians and Ge•tiles were equally advanced and favoured. 3. Vnity, I mean such as Christ came to establish (which is an Unity in heart and spirit) doth not in the least depend upon Uniformity, but upon Charity, i. e. a Christian and a Cand•d forbea•ance of one another i• things circumstantial, when we agree in the Essentials of Worship; which is a thing that meer Civility would teach, though Religion were silent in it.]

      * D. E.[C] And whereas the Bishop thinks he hath got some advantage, by reviving the memory of our late Civil •ars, which (were he either Christian  or Man enough, he would wish were eternally buried in silence) I must (to use his own Phrase) tell him in his ear, that our Wars did not arise from the separation of Conscie•tious dissenters, but from the violence and fury of unconscio•able Imposers, who would not allow their Brethren (who



desired nothing more than to live peacea•ly by them) that sob•〈◊〉 which the Law of God commanded, and no Law of Man could justly deprive them of.

      * D. E.[D] And whether the publick maintaining of the very same Positions and Practises, may not in time beget the same Feuds and Animosities, although this Bishop cares not, yet I doubt not but His Majesty, as he now doth, so will alwayes graciously consider.

    _ EXCEPTION VIII.

      * D. E.[A] WHether, as to the matter of Fact, the French Protestants do enjoyn standing at the Sacrament; and the Dutch, kneeling; I will labour to enform my self of some more Unbyassed witness than this Bish•p; for in the Ecclesiastical Laws of those Churches, which I have carefully perused, I can find no such matter. But if they did so, this would not at all justifie the Imposition of Kneeling; because 1. The Question is de Jure, whether it be lawful to prescribe any one such certain Posture, without submiting to which, it shall not be lawful to admit any to the Sacrament, and till the Affirmative of this be proved by Scriptures, Examples, and Instances from the Practice of men, will not satisfie a doubting conscience. 2. Neither of those fore-mentioned Postures are so much to exception as Kneeling; because this last is manifestly more superstitious, for, 1. It varies most of any from the First Pattern. 2. It hath been monstrously abused by the Papists to Idolatry; which alone renders it most unsafe to be practised, and most Unwarrantable to be imposed: Especially, till it be again explained as in the very first Liturgy of all it was; which I particularly mention, to shew how little our Reformation since Edw. 6th. time, hath been improved.]

    _ EXCEPTION IX.

      * D. E.[A] AS it was needlesly, so was it likewise Uncharitably done, to revile the whole body of Presbyterians for the Faults of Mr. Baxter; upon supposition that either he is a Presbyterian, or so culpable as the Bishop would make him. For since every man is to bear his own Burden, what Bible did the Bishop find it in, that he might, without scruple, asperse a whole order of Men, for the pretended miscarriage of one; who, by the Bishop's own Confession, was not of so Amicable and complyant a Temper as the rest: And therefore certainly they ought not to be brought in as Parties in that crime of Unpeaceableness, from which the Bishop just before had•absolved them: but choler spoyls the Memory; and, sure his Brethren the Bishops would not take it well of a Presbyterian, should he cry out Crimine ab uno, disce omnes—See what manner of Spirit these Bishops are of, and judge them all by the Bishop of Wercester's example. Truly, Sir, I am a little angry, when I consider how much this one mans Indiscretion hath exposed all of the same Order to Censure; For were they all like him (which I do not, nor dare not think) I should not scruple to pray heartily, what the Bishop doth in scorn concerning the Preachers—Lord deliver us from such Bishops. And let all the People say, Amen.

    _ POSTSCRIPT.

      * D. E.[A] THus, Sir, you see how willing I am to serve you in proposing my Exceptions, the fuller prosecution of which I must leave to  some other Pen, more able both in Divinity and Policy; who may convince both the Bishop and the World, that it is not yet time to sow such Tares; This Age is a liitle too knowing to be gulled with an A〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, or to take every thing for Oracle which a Bishops Passion distates. But before I case you of your Trouble in reading this, I will crave leave to give you a Taste of the Reverend Father's deep wisdom in two or three particulars.

      * D. E.[B] 1. In that he declaims, so fiercely, as if he would crack his Girdle, against all those who force all Communicants to come unto them, and be particularly examined before they admit th•m to the Sacrament. Indeed, Sir, this was an Imposition, as no way Justifiable, so, for ought I can hear, no where practised. The Custom being that men were only once for all examined, at their first coming to the Sacrament; which the Bishop himself allows under other Names of being Catechised and Instructed. It was therefore wisely done of the Bishop, this cold weather to set up a Man of straw, and then get himself heat by threshing it.

      * D. E.[C] 2. It is me-thinks very politickly d•ne to exclaim against the po•r  Covenant, and in great zeal to wish all the Books which defend it, were burnt by the Authors, to save the Hangman a labour. For here let his Adversary do what he can, the Bishop will be too hard for him: For if he takes no notice of the Covenant, the Bishop clearly gains the Cause; if he ventures to assert it, he shall presently be consuted with a Confiscation. So that under the shelter of this unanswerable Dilemma I leave him, le•t I should be gored with the Ho•ns of it. And this I speak, Sir, as one that though I never took, but alwayes opposed the Covenant; yet I have a very



good opinion of many that did, and withal a great Tenderness for the lawful part of an Oath, after it is o• solemnly taken. I will only add this, That since that Oath hath been so generally taken, even by those that were most active in his late Majesties service; and several times ventured their lives, to signalize their Loyalty; I think the Ashes of it (since it was burnt by publick Authority) had much better have been suffered to rest quietly, than thus to be blown up and scattered abroad by the Bishops furious breath, when no occasion was given him so much as to mention it.]
D. E.[D] Lastly, I can never enough commend the Bishops wisdom, in resolving so angrily never to wri[D] If the Bishop had the Libellers Experience of speaking more then he could Justifie, the Bishop m
